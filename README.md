# Hikari-LLVM22

An out-of-tree LLVM 22 obfuscation pass plugin that loads dynamically into
**`opt` or `rustc` nightly** — without rebuilding LLVM or rustc.

Derived from [Hikari-LLVM15](https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hikari-LLVM15) by 61bcdefg.

> **Platform note**: verified on **macOS arm64** (C and Rust) and on **Linux
> x86_64** (C, AArch64 cross-compilation, `opt` and the Debian package). Other
> platforms have not been tested end to end. If obfuscated code misbehaves,
> first drop the optimization level to **`-C opt-level=0`** (Rust) or **`-O0`**
> (C) — Hikari targets `-O0` IR.

## Prebuilt packages

Every release carries the plugin and the host that loads it, so nothing has to
be assembled by hand. See the [releases page](../../releases) for the current
checksums.

| Target | Artifact | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu / Debian x86_64 | `hikari_<version>_amd64.deb` | the plugin, an LLVM 22 `opt` with its `libLLVM`, and `hikari-clang` on `PATH` |
| Ubuntu / Debian arm64 | `hikari_<version>_arm64.deb` | the same, for `aarch64` hosts |
| Android, no NDK needed | `hikari-android-toolchain-full.tar.xz` | the plugin plus a bundled NDK: clang, lld, sysroot |
| Android, with your own NDK | `hikari-android-toolchain-slim.tar.xz` | the plugin, the LLVM 22 `opt` and the per-ABI wrappers |
| Termux (Android, aarch64) | `hikari_<version>_aarch64.deb` | the plugin built against Termux's own LLVM 21.1.8 — see [`tools/termux/README.md`](tools/termux/README.md) |
| Any LLVM 22 host | `libHikari.so` | the plugin on its own |

```bash
sudo dpkg -i hikari_1.0.0_amd64.deb
hikari-clang -O0 hello.c -o hello            # obfuscated
HIKARI_OBF=0 hikari-clang -O0 hello.c -o hi  # one clean build, to compare
```

Packaging details: [`tools/deb/README.md`](tools/deb/README.md) and
[`tools/android-toolchain/README.md`](tools/android-toolchain/README.md).

## Version alignment

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| LLVM this plugin targets | **22** |
| Homebrew `llvm` | 22.1.x (`brew install llvm`) |
| `rustc` stable | 1.97.x (LLVM 22) |
| `rustc` nightly | 1.99.x-nightly (LLVM 22) |

**rustc's LLVM major version has to match the LLVM this plugin was built
against**, or `-Zllvm-plugins` may fail to load it.

The build accepts LLVM **21** as well as 22. 21 is not a target of its own — it
is there because Termux ships 21.1.8 and nothing newer, and the only way to run
this on a phone is against the LLVM the phone has. The plugin builds against 21
and passes `smoke-test.sh` there (14/14, seeded sweep included). Anything older
is refused at configure time.

## Building

### Dependencies

- CMake ≥ 3.20, Ninja
- An LLVM 22 development package (headers and cmake config)
- macOS: `brew install llvm ninja cmake`

### Build

```bash
cmake -G "Ninja" -S . -B ./build \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
      -DLT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm
cmake --build ./build
```

Replace `LT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` with your LLVM 22 prefix (the CMake default is
`/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm`; on Debian and Ubuntu it is `/usr/lib/llvm-22`).

| Platform | Artifact |
|---|---|
| macOS | `build/obfuscation/libHikari.dylib` |
| Linux | `build/obfuscation/libHikari.so` |

## Usage

### Rust (nightly, dynamic loading)

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly

cargo new helloworld --bin
cd helloworld
cargo +nightly rustc --release -- \
  -C opt-level=0 \
  -Zllvm-plugins="/absolute/path/libHikari.dylib" \
  -Cpasses="hikari(enable-bcfobf,enable-cffobf,enable-strcry)"
```

### opt (C/C++, and anything else with LLVM IR)

```bash
clang -O0 -emit-llvm -c input.c -o input.bc

opt -load-pass-plugin="/absolute/path/libHikari.dylib" \
    --passes="hikari(enable-bcfobf,enable-cffobf,enable-strcry)" \
    input.bc -o output.bc

llc -filetype=obj output.bc -o output.o
clang output.o -o output
```

The pipeline name must be **`hikari(...)`**, with the individual switches inside.

The packaged `hikari-clang` driver runs those three stages for you and only
passes text IR between them; see
[`tools/android-toolchain/README.md`](tools/android-toolchain/README.md) for why
that is what makes an older clang able to feed an LLVM 22 plugin.

## Switches

| Switch | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hikari(...)` | enables the scheduler (**required** as the outer pass name) |
| `enable-allobf` | turns on most passes (see below) |
| `enable-bcfobf` | bogus control flow |
| `enable-cffobf` | control-flow flattening |
| `enable-subobf` | instruction substitution |
| `enable-splitobf` | basic-block splitting |
| `enable-strcry` | string encryption (C strings / Rust string data) |
| `enable-constenc` | constant encryption |
| `enable-indibran` | indirect branches |
| `enable-fco` | function-call obfuscation (`dlopen`/`dlsym` style) |
| `enable-funcwra` | function wrapping (known unstable) |
| `enable-antihook` | AntiHook (AArch64 inline / antirebind) |
| `enable-adb` | AntiDebugging |
| `enable-vmp` | **IR virtualization (VMP)**: translate functions into a private bytecode plus an interpreter |

`enable-allobf` turns on: `bcf`, `cff`, `sub`, `split`, `strcry`, `indibran`,
`fco`, `funcwra`.
It does **not** turn on: `constenc`, `antihook`, `adb`, `vmp` — ask for those
explicitly.

Environment variables work as an alternative to the `hikari()` arguments:
`BCFOBF`, `CFFOBF`, `SUBOBF`, `SPLITOBF`, `STRCRY`, `INDIBRAN`, `FCO`,
`FUNCWRA`, `ANTIHOOK`, `ADB`, `CONSTENC`, `ALLOBF`, `VMP`.

### VMP (`enable-vmp`)

IR-level virtual machine protection: functions are translated into a private
bytecode plus a re-entrant interpreter that lives on the stack.

| Mechanism | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Function annotation | `__attribute__((annotate("vmp")))`; exclude with `novmp` |
| Pipeline | `hikari()` processes only annotated functions; `hikari(enable-vmp)` tries every translatable function in the module |
| Environment | `VMP=1` is the same as `enable-vmp` |
| Encryption | on by default, L1 dual-seed (opcode + whole basic blocks); `VMPNOENC=1` or the `novmpenc` annotation turns it off; `VMPENCRYPT=1` or the `vmpenc` annotation forces it on |
| Combined with flattening | `hikari(enable-vmp,enable-cffobf)`: **VMP first, then CFF** (a preceding CFF on VMP targets is skipped automatically, to avoid the size blowup of flattening something that is then virtualized wholesale) |
| Hardening | `VMPHARDEN=1` or the `vmpharden` annotation: equivalent to running CFF over the virtualized function and its helpers (usable on its own, without `enable-cffobf`) |

**Supported IR (friendly to `-O0`)**

- Memory: `alloca` / `load` / `store` (an alloca's result is a real VA, so
  pointers can be handed out)
- Integers: binop / icmp (signed and unsigned) / cast / select
- Control flow: `br` / `ret` / `unreachable`
- `gep`: constant offsets, a single index, the common `[0, i]` array form
- `call`: direct and indirect, leaving through `vmp_ch_*` handlers
- Globals / function pointers: written into data slots by the launcher

**Runtime model**

- Per call: `data`, `ip` and the decryption state all live on the stack, so VMP
  functions are **re-entrant by default**, recursion included
- Bytecode: `@vmp_code_<fn>`; basic-block seed table: `@vmp_seeds_<fn>`
- Anything it cannot translate is **skipped wholesale** (visible as a
  `[VMP] skip/translate fail` log) rather than corrupting the module

**Explicitly unsupported (hard-fail skip)**

- varargs, exceptions/EH, floating point, vectors, complex multi-dynamic-index
  GEPs

Target functions should be `-O0` / `optnone`. Acceptance test:
`./samples/run_vmp.sh`.

**Full documentation** (architecture / bytecode / switches / mixing with CFF /
troubleshooting): [`docs/VMP.md`](docs/VMP.md).

### Removed

- **Objective-C support is gone entirely** (there was no test environment):
  - `enable-acdobf` / AntiClassDump
  - FCO's class/sel rewriting
  - strcry's CFString / NSString
  - antihook's ObjC runtime checks

This repository targets **C / Rust / ordinary LLVM IR**.

## Examples

The repository ships comparison scripts:

```bash
# build the plugin first (see above), then:
./samples/run_demo.sh
./samples/run_vmp.sh    # VMP correctness gate
```

See [`samples/README.md`](samples/README.md).

## Notes

1. **Dynamic loading** requires the host (`opt` / `rustc`) and the plugin to
   share the LLVM major version.
2. `enable-strcry` can still be unstable on some Rust code; turn strcry off or
   lower the optimization level if it misbehaves.
3. `enable-funcwra` is historically marked Broken and should not be enabled by
   default.
4. Control-flow passes (especially `indibran` + `bcf`) noticeably increase
   binary size and compile time.

## CI

Every gate lives in a script, so a human, a local runner and a hosted runner all
run the same thing — the workflows only decide *where*. See
[`docs/CI.md`](docs/CI.md).
